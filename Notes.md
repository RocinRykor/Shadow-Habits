The main idea that I want to build around with this app is going to be the Rolling For Chores option, AKA Story Mode.

### How it Works
The User will create a list of tasks they want to complete.
- Take out trash
- Clean dishes
- Vacuum Living Room
- Make Bed
- etc.

At the press of a button, a random item from the list will be chosen indicating that as the next task to complete.
By itself this turns chores into a bit of a game making them a little bit easier to complete.
My idea will be to add another game mechanic to this by providing the user with a randomly generated Shadowrun mission and by completing tasks messages will pop up to give updates on the mission.

For example: Upon creating the list and completing the first chore a message pops up indicating.

"The Johnson contacts you wanting to meet at an upscale restaurant, they claim to have a job that relies on your talents and promises the pay will be well worth it"

after another task is completed, the next bit of the story is revealed.

"You find the Johnson sitting at a corner booth in the back of the restaurant. You exchange introductions, and he begins to explain how he wishes you to sabotage the recent findings of a scientist in order to discredit him. While the Johnson doesn't tell you what Megacorp he is working for, you do glance at one of his guards as he adjusts his jacket briefly revealing an Ares logo embossed on his weapon holster."

And this repeats until the final task is completed. The length of the mission will be based on the length of the task list, so by completing the entire task list, upon finishing the mission will be resolved and the story wrapped up.
